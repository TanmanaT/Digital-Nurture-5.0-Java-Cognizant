# Exercise 3: Implementing Logging with Spring AOP

## Scenario
The library management application requires logging capabilities to track method execution times.

## Steps
1. **Add Spring AOP Dependency**:
   - Update `pom.xml` to include Spring AOP and AspectJ dependencies.
2. **Create an Aspect for Logging**:
   - Create a package `com.library.aspect` and add a class `LoggingAspect` with a method to log execution times.
3. **Enable AspectJ Support**:
   - Update `applicationContext.xml` to enable AspectJ support (`<aop:aspectj-autoproxy/>`) and register the aspect as a bean.
4. **Test the Aspect**:
   - Run the `LibraryManagementApplication` main class and observe the console for log messages indicating method execution times.
